README for caja/cut-n-paste-code

The code in this directory hierarchy was cut-n-pasted from
somewhere else.

In the soon to come, Star Trek future, this code will be available
as part of standard libraries.

For example, the code in libegg will be one day available as part
of Gtk+.

Until that happens, DON'T HACK the code, unless you are updating
from the original cut-n-paste source.

Instead of hacking the code in cut-n-paste-code, create subclasses
and put them in libcaja-extensions.

If you have any specific questions, comments or complaints about this
setup, open an issue on GitHub at:
